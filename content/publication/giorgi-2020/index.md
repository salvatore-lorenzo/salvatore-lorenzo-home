abstract: Under the Born-Markov approximation, a qubit system, such as a two-level
  atom, is known to undergo a memoryless decay of quantum coherence or excitation
  when weakly coupled to a featureless environment. Recently, it has been shown that
  unavoidable disorder in the environment is responsible for non-Markovian effects
  and information backflow from the environment into the system owing to Anderson
  localization. This turns disorder into a resource for enhancing non-Markovianity
  in the system-environment dynamics, which could be of relevance in cavity quantum
  electrodynamics. Here we consider the decoherence dynamics of a qubit weakly coupled
  to a two-dimensional bath with a nontrivial topological phase, such as a two-level
  atom embedded in a two-dimensional coupled-cavity array with a synthetic gauge field
  realizing a quantum-Hall bath, and show that Markovianity is protected against moderate
  disorder owing to the robustness of chiral edge modes in the quantum-Hall bath.
  Interestingly, switching off the gauge field, i.e., flipping the bath into a topological
  trivial phase, allows one to re-introduce non-Markovian effects. Such a result indicates
  that changing the topological phase of a bath by a tunable synthetic gauge field
  can be harnessed to control non-Markovian effects and quantum information backflow
  in a qubit-environment system. c 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

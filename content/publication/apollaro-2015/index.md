abstract: The transfer of an unknown quantum state, from a sender to a receiver, is
  one of the main requirements to perform quantum information processing (QIP) tasks.
  In this respect, the state transfer of a single qubit by means of spin chains has
  been widely discussed, and many protocols aiming at performing this task have been
  proposed. Nevertheless, the state transfer of more than one qubit has not been properly
  addressed so far. In this paper, we present a modified version of a recently proposed
  quantum state transfer (QST) protocol (Lorenzo S, Apollaro T J G, Sindona A and
  Plastina F 2013 Phys. Rev. A 87 042313) to obtain a quantum channel for the transfer
  of two qubits. This goal is achieved by exploiting Rabi-like oscillations due to
  excitations induced by means of strong and localized magnetic fields. We derive
  exact analytical formulae for the fidelity of the QST and obtain a high-quality
  transfer for general quantum states as well as for specific classes of states relevant
  for QIP.

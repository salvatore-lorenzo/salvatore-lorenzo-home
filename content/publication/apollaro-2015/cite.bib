 abstract = {The transfer of an unknown quantum state, from a sender to a receiver, is one of the main requirements to perform quantum information processing (QIP) tasks. In this respect, the state transfer of a single qubit by means of spin chains has been widely discussed, and many protocols aiming at performing this task have been proposed. Nevertheless, the state transfer of more than one qubit has not been properly addressed so far. In this paper, we present a modified version of a recently proposed quantum state transfer (QST) protocol (Lorenzo S, Apollaro T J G, Sindona A and Plastina F 2013 Phys. Rev. A 87 042313) to obtain a quantum channel for the transfer of two qubits. This goal is achieved by exploiting Rabi-like oscillations due to excitations induced by means of strong and localized magnetic fields. We derive exact analytical formulae for the fidelity of the QST and obtain a high-quality transfer for general quantum states as well as for specific classes of states relevant for QIP.},

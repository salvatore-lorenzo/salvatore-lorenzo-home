abstract: 'We study the dynamics of correlations in a paradigmatic setup to observe
  PT-symmetric physics: a pair of coupled oscillators, one subject to a gain one to
  a loss. Starting from a coherent state, quantum correlations (QCs) are created,
  despite the system being driven only incoherently, and can survive indefinitely.
  Both total and QCs exhibit different scalings of their long-time behavior in the
  PT-broken/unbroken phase and at the exceptional point (EP). In particular, PT symmetry
  breaking is accompanied by non-zero stationary QCs. This is analytically shown and
  quantitatively explained in terms of entropy balance. The EP in particular stands
  out as the most classical configuration, as classical correlations diverge while
  QCs vanish.'

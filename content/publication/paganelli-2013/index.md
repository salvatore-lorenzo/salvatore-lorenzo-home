abstract: Two different models are presented that allow for efficiently performing
  routing of a quantum state. Both cases involve an XX spin chain working as a data
  bus and additional spins that play the role of sender and receivers, one of which
  is selected to be the target of the quantum state transmission protocol via a coherent
  quantum coupling mechanism making use of local and/or global magnetic fields. Quantum
  routing is achieved in the first of the models considered by weakly coupling the
  sender and the receiver to the data bus. On the other hand, in the second model,
  local magnetic fields acting on additional spins located between the sender and
  receiver and the data bus allow us to perform high-fidelity routing. Â© 2013 American

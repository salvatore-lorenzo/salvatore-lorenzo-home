abstract: We combine the collisional picture for open system dynamics and the control
  of the rate of decoherence provided by the quantum (anti-)Zeno effect to illustrate
  the temporal unfolding of the redundant encoding of information into a multipartite
  environment that is at the basis of quantum Darwinism, and to control it. The rate
  at which such encoding occurs can be enhanced or suppressed by tuning the dynamical
  conditions of system-environment interaction in a suitable and remarkably simple
  manner. This would help the design of a new generation of quantum experiments addressing
  the elusive phenomenology of quantum Darwinism and thus its characterization.

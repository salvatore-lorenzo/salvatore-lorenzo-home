 abstract = {We study the dynamics of a chain of interacting quantum particles affected by an individual or collective environment(s), focusing on the role played by the environmental quantum correlations over the evolution of the chain. The presence of entanglement in the state of the environment magnifies the non-Markovian nature of the chain's dynamics, giving rise to structures in figures of merit such as spin entanglement and purity that are not observed under a separable environmental state. Our analysis can be relevant to problems tackling the open-system dynamics of biological complexes of strong current interest. Â© 2011 American Physical Society.},

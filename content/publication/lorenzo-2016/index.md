abstract: A well-known situation in which a non-Markovian dynamics of an open quantum
  system S arises is when this is coherently coupled to an auxiliary system M in contact
  with a Markovian bath. In such cases, while the joint dynamics of S-M is Markovian
  and obeys a standard (bipartite) Lindblad-type master equation (ME), this is in
  general not true for the reduced dynamics of S. Furthermore, there are several instances
  (e.g., the dissipative Jaynes-Cummings model) in which a closed ME for the S's state
  cannot even be worked out. Here, we find a class of bipartite Lindblad-type MEs
  such that the reduced ME of S can be derived exactly and in a closed form for any
  initial product state of S-M. We provide a detailed microscopic derivation of our
  result in terms of a mapping between two collision models.

abstract: Quantum Darwinism attempts to explain the emergence of objective reality
  of the state of a quantum system in terms of redundant information about the system
  acquired by independent noninteracting fragments of the environment. The consideration
  of interacting environmental elements gives rise to a rich phenomenology, including
  the occurrence of non-Markovian features, whose effects on objectification in the
  manner of quantum Darwinism needs to be fully understood. We study a model of local
  interaction between a simple quantum system and a multimode environment that allows
  for a clear investigation of the interplay between information trapping and propagation
  in the environment and the emergence of quantum Darwinism. We provide strong evidence
  of the correlation between non-Markovianity and quantum Darwinism in such a model,
  thus providing strong evidence of a potential link between such fundamental phenomena.

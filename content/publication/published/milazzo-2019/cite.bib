 abstract = {Quantum Darwinism attempts to explain the emergence of objective reality of the state of a quantum system in terms of redundant information about the system acquired by independent noninteracting fragments of the environment. The consideration of interacting environmental elements gives rise to a rich phenomenology, including the occurrence of non-Markovian features, whose effects on objectification in the manner of quantum Darwinism needs to be fully understood. We study a model of local interaction between a simple quantum system and a multimode environment that allows for a clear investigation of the interplay between information trapping and propagation in the environment and the emergence of quantum Darwinism. We provide strong evidence of the correlation between non-Markovianity and quantum Darwinism in such a model, thus providing strong evidence of a potential link between such fundamental phenomena.},

abstract: We provide a new perspective on shadow tomography by demonstrating its deep
  connections with the general theory of measurement frames. By showing that the formalism
  of measurement frames offers a natural framework for shadow tomography – in which
  ``classical shadows'' correspond to unbiased estimators derived from a suitable
  dual frame associated with the given measurement – we highlight the intrinsic connection
  between standard state tomography and shadow tomography. Such perspective allows
  us to examine the interplay between measurements, reconstructed observables, and
  the estimators used to process measurement outcomes, while paving the way to assess
  the influence of the input state and the dimension of the underlying space on estimation
  errors. Our approach generalizes the method described in [H.-Y. Huang  it et al.,
  Nat. Phys. 16, 1050 (2020)], whose results are recovered in the special case of
  covariant measurement frames. As an application, we demonstrate that a sought-after
  target of shadow tomography can be achieved for the entire class of tight rank-1
  measurement frames – namely, that it is possible to accurately estimate a finite
  set of generic rank-1 bounded observables while avoiding the growth of the number
  of the required samples with the state dimension.

abstract: Quantum information scrambling (QIS), from the perspective of quantum information
  theory, is generally understood as local non-retrievability of information evolved
  through some dynamical process, and is often quantified via entropic quantities
  such as the tripartite information. We argue that this approach comes with a number
  of issues, in large part due to its reliance on quantum mutual informations, which
  do not faithfully quantify correlations directly retrievable via measurements, and
  in part due to the specific methodology used to compute tripartite informations
  of the studied dynamics. We show that these issues can be overcome by using accessible
  mutual informations, defining corresponding ‘accessible tripartite informations’,
  and provide explicit examples of dynamics whose scrambling properties are not properly
  quantified by the standard tripartite information. Our results lay the groundwork
  for a more profound understanding of what QIS represents, and reveal a number of
  promising, as of yet unexplored, venues for further research.

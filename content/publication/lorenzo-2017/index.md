abstract: As discovered by P. W. Anderson, excitations do not propagate freely in
  a disordered lattice, but, due to destructive interference, they localise. As a
  consequence, when an atom interacts with a disordered lattice, one indeed observes
  a non-trivial excitation exchange between atom and lattice. Such non-trivial atomic
  dynamics will in general be characterised also by a non-trivial quantum information
  backflow, a clear signature of non-Markovian dynamics. To investigate the above
  scenario, we consider a quantum emitter, or atom, weakly coupled to a uniform coupled-cavity
  array (CCA). If initially excited, in the absence of disorder, the emitter undergoes
  a Markovian spontaneous emission by releasing all its excitation into the CCA (initially
  in its vacuum state). By introducing static disorder in the CCA the field normal
  modes become Anderson-localized, giving rise to a non-Markovian atomic dynamics.
  We show the existence of a functional relationship between a rigorous measure of
  quantum non-Markovianity and the CCA localization. We furthermore show that the
  average non-Markovianity of the atomic dynamics is well-described by a phenomenological
  model in which the atom is coupled, at the same time, to a single mode and to a
  standard - Markovian - dissipative bath.

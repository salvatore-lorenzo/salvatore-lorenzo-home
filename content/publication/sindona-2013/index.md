abstract: The Fermi-edge singularity and the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe describe
  the universal physics which occurs when a Fermi sea is locally quenched by the sudden
  switching of a scattering potential, leading to a brutal disturbance of its ground
  state. We demonstrate that the effect can be seen in the controllable domain of
  ultracold trapped gases by providing an analytic description of the out-of-equilibrium
  response to an atomic impurity, both at zero and at finite temperature. Furthermore,
  we link the transient behavior of the gas to the decoherence of the impurity, and
  to the degree of the non-Markovian nature of its dynamics. Â© 2013 American Physical

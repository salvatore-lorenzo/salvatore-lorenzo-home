abstract: Resonance fluorescence, consisting of light emission from an atom driven
  by a classical oscillating field, is well-known to yield a sub-Poissonian photon
  counting statistics. This occurs when only emitted light is detected, which corresponds
  to a master equation (ME) unraveling in terms of the canonical jump operator describing
  spontaneous decay. Formally, an alternative ME unraveling is possible in terms of
  a shifted jump operator. We show that this shift can result in sub-Poissonian, Poissonian
  or super-Poissonian quantum jump statistics. This is shown in terms of the Mandel
  Q parameter in the limit of long counting times, which is computed through large
  deviation theory. We present a waveguide-QED setup, comprising a chiral waveguide
  coupled to a driven atom, where photon counting is described by the considered class
  of shifted jump operators.

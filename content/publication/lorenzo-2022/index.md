abstract: We study the emergence of synchronisation in a chiral network of harmonic
  oscillators. The network consists of a set of locally incoherently pumped harmonic
  oscillators coupled pairwise in cascade with travelling field modes. Such cascaded
  coupling leads to feedback-less dissipative interaction between the harmonic oscillators
  of the pair which can be described in terms of an effective pairwise Hamiltonian
  a collective pairwise decay. The network is described mathematically in terms of
  a directed graph. By analysing geometries of increasing complexity we show how the
  onset of synchronisation depends strongly on the network topology, with the emergence
  of synchronised communities in the case of complex networks. The quantum nature
  of the non local correlation between network nodes is assessed.

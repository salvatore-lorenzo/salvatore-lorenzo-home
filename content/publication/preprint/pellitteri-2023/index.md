abstract: We study the dynamics of a pair of optomechanical systems interacting dissipatively
  with a wave guide in a unidirectional way. We investigate the behaviour of both
  classical and quantum correlations established between the two mechanical modes
  both in the transient and in the stationary regime. We find that a constant amount
  of steady correlations can exists at long times. We furthermore analyze the power
  spectrum of the output guide field and we show how from such spectrum it is possible
  to reconstruct the spectra of each single mirror. Finally we show that that, thanks
  to the unidirectional coupling, a temperature gradient between the mirrors depending
  on the frequencies detuning is established .

abstract: The transfer of quantum information between different locations is key to
  many quantum information processing tasks. Whereas, the transfer of a single qubit
  state has been extensively investigated, the transfer of a many-body system configuration
  has insofar remained elusive. We address the problem of transferring the state of
  n interacting qubits. Both the exponentially increasing Hilbert space dimension,
  and the presence of interactions significantly scale-up the complexity of achieving
  high-fidelity transfer. By employing tools from random matrix theory and using the
  formalism of quantum dynamical maps, we derive a general expression for the average
  and the variance of the fidelity of an arbitrary quantum state transfer protocol
  for n interacting qubits. Finally, by adopting a weak-coupling scheme in a spin
  chain, we obtain the explicit conditions for high-fidelity transfer of three and
  four interacting qubits.

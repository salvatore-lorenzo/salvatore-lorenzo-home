abstract: 'Quantum non-Markovianity and quantum Darwinism are two phenomena linked
  by a common theme: the flux of quantum information between a quantum system and
  the quantum environment it interacts with. In this work, making use of a quantum
  collision model, a formalism initiated by Sudarshan and his school, we will analyse
  the efficiency with which the information about a single qubit gained by a quantum
  harmonic oscillator, acting as a meter, is transferred to a bosonic environment.
  We will show how, in some regimes, such quantum information flux is inefficient,
  leading to the simultaneous emergence of non-Markovian and non-darwinistic behaviours.'

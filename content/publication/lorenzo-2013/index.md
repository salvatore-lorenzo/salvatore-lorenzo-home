abstract: Efficient quantum-state transfer is achieved in a uniformly coupled spin-1/2
  chain, with open boundaries, by application of local magnetic fields on the second
  and last-but-one spins, respectively. These effective barriers induce the appearance
  of two eigenstates, bilocalized at the edges of the chain, which allow a high-quality
  transfer also at relatively long distances. The same mechanism may be used to send
  an entire e-bit (e.g., an entangled qubit pair) from one to the other end of the
  chain. Â© 2013 American Physical Society.

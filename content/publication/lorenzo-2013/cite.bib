 abstract = {Efficient quantum-state transfer is achieved in a uniformly coupled spin-1/2 chain, with open boundaries, by application of local magnetic fields on the second and last-but-one spins, respectively. These effective barriers induce the appearance of two eigenstates, bilocalized at the edges of the chain, which allow a high-quality transfer also at relatively long distances. The same mechanism may be used to send an entire e-bit (e.g., an entangled qubit pair) from one to the other end of the chain. Â© 2013 American Physical Society.},

abstract: We investigate the transfer of genuine multipartite entanglement across
  a spin-1/2 chain with nearest-neighbour XX-type interaction. We focus on the perturbative
  regime, where a block of spins is weakly coupled at each edge of a quantum wire,
  embodying the role of a multiqubit sender and receiver, respectively. We find that
  high-quality multipartite entanglement transfer is achieved at the same time that
  three excitations are transferred to the opposite edge of the chain. Moreover, we
  find that both a finite concurrence and tripartite negativity is attained at much
  shorter time, making GHZ-distillation protocols feasible. Finally, we investigate
  the robustness of our protocol with respect to non-perturbative couplings and increasing
  lengths of the quantum wire.

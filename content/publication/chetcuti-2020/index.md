abstract: The transfer of excitations between different locations of a quantum many-body
  system is of primary importance in many research areas, from transport properties
  in spintronics and atomtronics to quantum state transfer in quantum information
  processing. We address the transfer of n Â¿ 1 bosonic and fermionic excitations between
  the edges of a one-dimensional chain modelled by a quadratic hopping Hamiltonian,
  where the block edges, embodying the sender and the receiver sites, are weakly coupled
  to the quantum wire. We find that perturbative high-quality transfer is attainable
  in the weak-coupling limit, for both bosons and fermions, only for certain modular
  arithmetic equivalence classes of the wire's length. Finally we apply our findings
  to the transport of spins and the charging of a many-body quantum battery.

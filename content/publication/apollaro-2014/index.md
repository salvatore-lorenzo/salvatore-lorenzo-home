abstract: We study the competing effects of simultaneous Markovian and non-Markovian
  decoherence mechanisms acting on a single spin. We show the existence of a threshold
  in the relative strength of such mechanisms above which the spin dynamics becomes
  fully Markovian, as revealed by the use of several non-Markovianity measures. We
  identify a measure-dependent nested structure of such thresholds, hinting at a causality
  relationship among the various non-Markovianity witnesses used in our analysis.
  Our considerations are then used to argue the unavoidably non-Markovian evolution
  of a single-electron quantum dot exposed to both intrinsic and Markovian technical
  noise, the latter of arbitrary strength. Â© 2014 American Physical Society.
